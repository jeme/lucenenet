	/// A revision comprises lists of files that come from different sources and need
	/// to be replicated together to e.g. guarantee that all resources are in sync.
	/// In most cases an application will replicate a single index, and so the
	/// revision will contain files from a single source. However, some applications
	/// may require to treat a collection of indexes as a single entity so that the
	/// files from all sources are replicated together, to guarantee consistency
	/// beween them. For example, an application which indexes facets will need to
	/// replicate both the search and taxonomy indexes together, to guarantee that
	/// they match at the client side.
